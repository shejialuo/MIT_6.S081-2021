# MIT 6.S081 2021

This is my solutions for [6.S081](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/schedule.html) Labs.

In ArchLinux, it is easy to set up the build environment:

```sh
sudo pacman -S riscv64-linux-gnu-binutils \
               riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc      \
               riscv64-linux-gnu-gdb      \
               qemu-arch-extra
```

## Summary

Now I have nearly finished the whole courses, due to the time, I drop `net` lab and `mmap` lab.
Although these are interesting, I don't have enough time. Because I want to move on to another
open course. Actually, if you want to do these labs more comfortably, you should read the whole
xv6 code. Don't worry about it, it's worth reading.

If you want to know how I read the source code, you could go to my [code_for_study](https://github.com/shejialuo/code_for_stduy/blob/master/OS/xv6-riscv/) to see
the docs I write for learning the source code of xv6.

Thanks again for the MIT 6.S081 staffs who bring the world a great course.
